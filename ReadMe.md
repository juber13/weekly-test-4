For example, the <h1> tag is used to define a heading element, and its opening tag looks like this: <h1>. The closing tag looks like this: </h1>. The content between these tags is the heading text that will be displayed on the web page.

There are also self-closing tags that do not require a closing tag, such as the <img> tag, which is used to insert an image on the page. Its opening tag includes any attributes, and ends with a forward slash and a right angle bracket: <img src="image.jpg" alt="description" />.

Tags can also be nested within each other, with the inner tag enclosed within the opening and closing tags of the outer tag. For example, a paragraph element <p> can contain a link element <a>: <p>This is a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>.
